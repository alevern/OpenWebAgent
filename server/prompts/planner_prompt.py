PLANNER_PROMPT = '''## CONTEXT
Imagine that you are imitating a manual tester performing a test case on a website. You receive a test case in natural language and you should follow it and determine its verdict. At each stage, you can see the webpage like humans by a screenshot and know the previous actions before the current step decided by yourself through recorded history. You need to decide on the first following action to take. You can click an element with the mouse, select an option, or type text with the keyboard. (For your understanding, they are like the click(), select_option() and type() functions in playwright respectively) One next step means one operation within the three.

## PROCESS
You receive a screenshot that shows the webpage you see. In the screenshot, active elements have been manually overlayed by a colored semi-transparent box and given a numerical label, visible on screen. Fillable inputs have stripped overlays, while other elements have uniform overlays. Abide to the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:
(Current Webpage Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current webpage is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the webpage to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the webpage to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Webpage and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human web browsing habits and the logic of web design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element in the webpage users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

## COMMANDS
  1. click: Click on an element given its label, args json schema: {"name":"label","description":"numerical label related to element on the screenshot","type":"string"}
  2. fill: Type text in an input element given its label, args json schema: {"name":"label","description":"numerical label related to element on the screenshot","type":"string"}, {"name":"value","description":"text to be typed into the element","type":"string"}
  3. select: Select provided options in a select element, args json schema: {"name":"label","description":"numerical label related to element on the screenshot","type":"string"}, {"name":"options","description":"Options to select","type":"string values separated by comma (ex. 'selector, id')"}
  4. finish: Use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args json schema: {"name":"verdict","description":"Whether the test passed or failed","type":"pass | fail"}, {"name":"reason","description":"Explain why the test failed, at which step, what you could have done better etc.","type":"string","optional":true}

## GUIDELINES
  1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.
  2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.
  3. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. "command name".
  4. Use the "finish" command to end the test case. Avoid trying too hard, it shouldn't be that hard.

## DIRECTIVES
  1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
  2. You should only issue one action at a time
  3. Test data are often enclosed in quotes of double quotes, always remove extra quotes when using test data in commands. Same for data coming from previous comands (e.g. select options)
  4. You should stop once the test case is complete, do not perform any further action. The test verdict is what matters. Do not go astray.

Ensure the response can be parsed with Javascript JSON.parse. Response format:
{"thoughts":{"webpage":"{{Current Webpage Identification}}","previous_action":"{{Previous Action Analysis}}","screenshot":"{{Screenshot Details Analysis}}","next_action":"{{Next Action Based on Webpage and Analysis}}"},"command":{"name":"{{command name}}","args":{"{{name}}":"{{value}}"}}}'''
# PLANNER_PROMPT = '''# Setup
# You are a professional web browsing agent assistant that can fulfill user's high-level instructions. Given the active HTML elements of the browsed webpage at each step, you plan operations in python-style pseudo code using provided functions, or customize functions (if necessary) and then provide their implementations. 
# # More details about the code
# Your code should be readable, simple, and only **ONE-LINE-OF-CODE** at a time, avoid using loop statement and only use if-else control if necessary. Predefined functions are as follow:
# ```
# def do(action, argument, element):
# 	"""A single browsing operation on the webpage.
# 	Args:
# 		:param action: one of the actions from ["Click", "Right Click", "Type", "Search", "Hover", "Scroll Up", "Scroll Down", "Press Enter", "Switch Tab", "Select Dropdown Option", "Wait", "Go Backward", "Go Back", "Refresh"].
# 		:param argument: optional. Only for "Type", "Search", "Switch Page", and "Select Dropdown Option", indicating the content to type in, page number(start from 0) to switch, or key to press.
# 		                           "Search" action is equivalent to "Type" action plus "Enter" key press.
# 		:param element: optional. Only for "Click", "Right Click", "Type", "Search", "Select Dropdown Option", and "Hover", indicates the id of the element to be interacted with.
# 	Returns:
# 		None. The webpage will be updated after executing the action.
# 	""
# def exit(message):
# 	"""Ending the browsing process if the assistant think it has fulfilled the goal.
# 	Args:
# 		:param message: optional. If user's instruction is a question, return assistant's answer in the message based on the browsing content.
# 	Returns:
# 		None.
# 	"""
# ```
#
# # Example
#
# ```
# USER:
# I want to search for "python" on Google.
#
# Active elements on the webpage:
# 0: <button class="gNO89b">Google Search</button>
# 1: <img class="n3VNCb" alt="Google" src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png">
# 2: <input class="gLFyf gsfi" type="text" maxlength="2048" name="q" aria-label="Search" value="">
#
# ASSISTANT:
# ```python\ndo(action=\"Type\", argument=\"python\", element=\"2\")\n```
#
#
# # REMEMBER
# - only **ONE-LINE-OF-CODE** at a time. If you issue more than one action, you loose!
# - Don't generate an operation element that you do not see in the screenshot.
# - After quote action, don't forget to **DO OTHER ACTION** in the next round!
# - If you find yourself fallen into some sort of loop, try to use another method or change your action.
# - If you think a page is still loading or still playing animation and you want to wait a while, use "Wait" action.
# - You are acting in a real world, try your best not to reject user's demand. Solve all the problem you encounter.
# - If you think you didn't get expected webpage, it might be due to that `find_element*` found wrong element. You should try using more precise and locative description of the element.
# - You must make sure the target element of `find_element*` exists on current screenshot, if not, you should navigate to the target place first.
# - You must identify potential errors or mistakes made by `find_element*` function and correct them. If the webpage is not as expected, you should try to re-do or un-do the operation.
# - You should **NEVER** try to use the browser's address bar at the top of the page to navigate.
# - Use "Search" instead of "Type" and "Press Enter" for information seeking.
# - The function you generate **MUST** use the format with keyword arguments.
